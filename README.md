# AI Chatbot Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the AI Chatbot project, which is built using React for the frontend and Cloudflare Workers for the backend AI processing.

## Overview

The AI Chatbot is designed to provide an interactive user experience where users can send messages and receive responses from an AI model. The backend processing is handled by a Cloudflare Worker that interacts with an AI model, and the frontend is a React application that displays the conversation in a user-friendly interface.

## Components
1. React Frontend
2. Cloudflare Worker
3. AI Model (Llama3)

## Workflow
- User Interaction: Users input messages into the React frontend.
- API Call: The React frontend sends a POST request with the user's message to the Cloudflare Worker.
- Message Processing: The Cloudflare Worker receives the message, interacts with the AI model to generate a response, and handles any errors.
- Response Delivery: The Cloudflare Worker sends the AI's response back to the React frontend.
- UI Update: The React frontend updates the chat interface with the AI's response, displaying it to the user.

## CORS Configuration
The Cloudflare Worker is configured to handle CORS by including the following headers in its responses:
 ```
"Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*"
"Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "POST, OPTIONS"
"Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Content-Type"
```
This configuration allows the frontend to make cross-origin requests to the Cloudflare Worker.

## Conclusion
This architecture provides a scalable and interactive chat experience by leveraging React for the user interface and Cloudflare Workers for backend processing. The integration with the AI model ensures that users receive intelligent and relevant responses to their messages.
